# open-road
This is an app that allows you to filter routes in a nontraditional sense.

## MVP Requirements
- A user will be able to plan and save routes. These routes will come with an explorable map (and generated 3d visualizations.) -> (stetch)
- A user will be able to explore 10-20 popular motocycle routes, which will include the 3d visualizations.
- A user will be able to leave comments and discuss routes.
- A user will be able to access a news feed with up to date information on motorcycle and motorcycle road trip news articles.
- An admin will be able to add, edit, and remove routes and users.
- An admin will be able to remove comments.
- Our app will be web based, but mobile friendly.

## Stretch Goals
- A user will be able to upvote, or rate a route to increase its popularity.
- A user will be able to make a route public and rate/comment on the experience.
- A user will be able to follow other users and preview their routes as a 'suggestion'
- A user will be able to earn 'badges' based on miles traveled or for creating popular routes.
- A user will be given suggestions based on routes created by badged users.
- We will create a mobile app to support our web application.
